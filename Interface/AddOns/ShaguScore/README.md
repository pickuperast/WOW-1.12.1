# ShaguScore

This AddOn is a GearScore alike item rating. It includes a small database of the itemLevels of all items available in classic up to Naxxramas. Those values are are printed as score, similar to GearScore. Please don't take those values to serious, in vanilla the itemLevel is worth nothing.

## Older Versions

In older versions this addon did two things, it calculated the average color (rarity) of the player's equip and it aggregated a score of the overall equip.

The score value has been calculated as followed:

    Score = Rarity * ItemLevel * Bonus

**Rarity:**
<span style="color: #9d9d9d">Poor (0)</span>,
<span style="color: #000000">Common (1)</span>,
<span style="color: #1eff00">Uncommon (2)</span>,
<span style="color: #0080ff">Rare (3)</span>,
<span style="color: #b048f8">Epic (4)</span>,
<span style="color: #ff8000">Legendary (5)</span>,
<span style="color: #e6cc80">Artifact (6)</span>

**Bonus:** 
The Bonus is 2 when a TwoHand weapon is used, otherwise it will be 1
